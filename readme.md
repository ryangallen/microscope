Microscope is a simple social news app that lets you share links, comment, and vote on them.

It was built with <a href="http://meteor.com/">Meteor</a> as a companion app to <a href="http://themeteorbook.com/">The Meteor Book</a>, and is the "little brother" of <a href="http://telesc.pe/">Telescope</a>, the (much more complex) open-source social news app that was the inspiration for the book.
